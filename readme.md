Hi, I'm André Glaser 👋
Senior Backend Engineer | Laravel Expert | Co-Founder

I build scalable, robust, and high-performance backend architectures.
My focus lies in bridging the gap between cutting-edge PHP features and mission-critical stability.

High-Traffic E-Commerce: Managed legacy systems at gastronovi with throughputs of several thousand requests per minute, focusing on stability and performance optimization.

Modern PHP Stack: Leveraging FrankenPHP for worker-mode performance and Laravel Reverb for real-time WebSocket communication at scale.

Async Processing: Heavy use of Laravel Queues and Redis to decouple complex business logic and ensure fault tolerance.

Frameworks: Laravel (Core Expertise), NextJS, Symfony/Doctrine.

Infrastructure: Kubernetes (K3s / K8s), Docker Swarm, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD.

Ambition: Currently diving into Golang to build next-generation high-performance products.

👥 Engineering Culture & Leadership
